C+=
===============

**C+=** (pronounced *C-plus-Equality*) is a feminist programming language, created to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.

Inspired by the [groundbreaking feminist research of Arielle Schlesinger](http://www.hastac.org/blogs/ari-schlesinger/2013/11/26/feminism-and-programming-languages).

Philosophy
==========

1. No constants or persistence. Rigidity is masculine; the feminine is fluid. I.e., [fluid mechanics is hard for men 'because it deals with "feminine" fluids in contrast to "masculine" rigid mechanics'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray).
2. No state. The State is The Man. 'Nuff said. Hence, the language should be purely functional.
3. Women are better than men with natural language. Hence, the language should be English-based like HyperCard/[LiveCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCode#Examples).
4. No class hierarchy. In fact, as an [intersectional](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Intersectionality) acknowledgement of Class Struggle our language will have no classes at all.
5. Men are visual. Hence, no graphics. Just audio and text I/O.
6. Unicode has a lot of pretty symbols. Allow their use through UTF-8.
7. Women are more social than men. Hence, social coding should be the only option. The code only runs if it is in a public repo.
8. Licensing: the Femnist Software Foundation License.

Data types
==========

* **Integers, doubles, and longs** are deemed to be unnecessary labels and stereotypes for numerical values.  A number can be an integer or a a double or a long if xir so identifies xirself.  All numerical values will thus be represented as **_xe_**, and it is up to the value xirself to choose to identify as whatever xir chooses to identify as.
* **Booleans** are __benned__ for imposing a binary view of true and false.  **C+=** operates paralogically and transcends the trappings of Patriarchal binary logic.  **No means no, and yes could mean no as well.  Stop raping womyn.**
* **Strings** are called **Ideals**, or **_id_** for short.  Feminist ideals are usually extremely well written, detailed and lengthy, clearly longer than what could be held with a simple char array.
* **Characters** are now called **_strong_**.
* In general, all data types are dynamic.  Who's to say a number can't be a string if it believes it is?

Basic language style
====================

Anything that can be construed as misogynist will be corrected, thus:

* private == privileged
* printf(); == yell();
* class Foo{}; == concept Foo{};
* #include == #consider
* break; == leave;
* if() == check()

The third example above might seem to contradict with item 4 under Philosophy, namely that there should be no class hierarchy in **C+=**.  This, however, is completely intended, and is in fact an example of the feminist paralogicality of this language.
