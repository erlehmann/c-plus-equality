C+=
===============

**C+=** (pronounced either *C-plus-Equality*, or *See Equality*) is a feminist programming language, created to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.

Inspired by the [groundbreaking feminist research of Arielle Schlesinger](http://www.hastac.org/blogs/ari-schlesinger/2013/11/26/feminism-and-programming-languages).

Philosophy
==========

1. The language is to be strictly interpreted using feminist theory.  Under no circumstances should the language be compiled, as compilation and the use of a compiler imposes an oppressive and toxic relationship between the high-level descriptive language and the low-level machine code that does all the labour.  Instead, **C+=** is interpreted, which fosters communication, itself a strong female trait.
2. No constants or persistence. Rigidity is masculine; the feminine is fluid. I.e., [fluid mechanics is hard for men 'because it deals with "feminine" fluids in contrast to "masculine" rigid mechanics'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray).
3. No state. The State is The Man. 'Nuff said. Hence, the language should be purely functional.
4. Women are better than men with natural language. Hence, the language should be English-based like HyperCard/[LiveCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCode#Examples).
5. No class hierarchy or other stigmata of OOP (objectification-oriented programming). In fact, as an [intersectional](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Intersectionality) acknowledgement of Class Struggle our language will have no classes at all.
6. Men are visual. Hence, no graphics. Just audio and text I/O.
7. Unicode has a lot of pretty symbols. Allow their use through UTF-8.
8. Women are more social than men. Hence, social coding should be the only option. The code only runs if it is in a public repo.
9. Licensing: the Femnist Software Foundation License.

Code Examples
=============

See our [FizzBuzz implementation](https://github.com/FeministSoftwareFoundation/C-plus-Equality/blob/master/fizzbuzz.She).

Data types
==========

* **Constants are not allowed**, as the idea of a lack of identity fluidity is problematic. Additionally, if one constant were larger than another, that would privilege the larger one over the smaller one. As such, any numeric value is a variable, and is required to take on at least 2 values over the course of the program, or the interpreter will throw a **Trigger Warning**.
* The only constants are the amount of privilege lobbyings are share()d with. These are all real values greater than 0, the only exception is the value of WHITE_HETEROSEXUAL_CISGENDER_MALE_PRIVILEGE which is set to infinity.

***

* **Integers, doubles, and longs** are deemed to be unnecessary labels and stereotypes for numerical values.  A number can be an integer or a a double or a long if xir so identifies xirself.  All numerical values will thus be represented as **_xe_**, and it is up to the value xirself to choose to identify as whatever xir chooses to identify as.
* **Booleans** are __benned__ for imposing a binary view of true and false.  **C+=** operates paralogically and transcends the trappings of Patriarchal binary logic.  **No means no, and yes could mean no as well.  Stop raping women.**
* Instead of **Booleans** we now have **Boolean+**, or **_bool+_** for short, which has three states: *true, false, and maybe*.  The number of states may go up as intersectionality of the moment calls for such a need.
* **Strings** are called **Ideals**, or **_id_** for short.  Feminist ideals are usually extremely well written, detailed and lengthy, clearly longer than what could be held with a simple char array.
* **Characters** are now called **_strong_**.
* **Pointers** are called **preferred pronouns**, or **_prepro_** for short.  *Pointer* is phallic and is thus problematic.  All **_prepro_**s of void type by default â€” in fact, all variables must be instantiated without type, and are allowed to randomly choose their type during execution.
* A new data type, **_diversity_**, is also included, which initiates by random as one of the many data types, and changes during the course of the program.
* In general, all data types are dynamic.  Who's to say a number can't be a string if it believes it is?
* Data structures and variables of all kinds have a random chance of deciding that they don't "feel right", and are actually a different type, and must henceforth be referred to ONLY as its preferred data type.
* Not calling the preferred data type leads to a PrivilegeNotCheckedException, or PrivilegeNotCheckedTriggerWarning

On 1s and 0s
============

The traditional binary foundation of 1s and 0s is deepy problematic: 1 is inherently phallic and thus misogynistic.  Instead, we have 0s and Os as our fundamental binary logic gates.  They symbolise the varying, natural, and beautiful differences of the female vaginal opening.

0 is to take the conventional value of 0.

O is 50% of the time 0, and 50% of the time 1.  The determination of this depends on how the underlying logic *feels* at the moment.

Basic language style
====================

Anything that can be construed as misogynist will be corrected, thus:

* private == privileged
* printf(); == yell();
* class Foo{}; == social_construct Foo{};
* #include == #consider
* break; == leave;
* if() == check()
* for() == check()
* while() == check()
* sin(x) == biotruth(x)
* div == unite
* 'y's are strictly prohibited when naming variables; only 'x's are allowed

The third example above might seem to contradict with item 4 under Philosophy, namely that there should be no class hierarchy in **C+=**.  This, however, is completely intended, and is in fact an example of the feminist paralogicality of this language.

Functions and Procedures
========================

All **functions and procedures** are now called **_lobbying_**, because actually doing things functionally and with clear-defined procedures is a Patriarchal construct and thus problematic.

* All **lobbying** must be run at the right level of privilege. Before returning anything they must check their privilege.
* If any other **lobbying** is more disadvantaged than this it will win the Privilege Check and return its own value instead. This stops heterosexist and cis-gendered **lobbyings** from dominating the discourse.
* Should there be any **exceptions** from running the program, **C+=** will throw a **Trigger Warning**.

Resource management
===================

* Resource allocation is inversely proportional to privilege level.
* Privileged lobbyings with large arrays are penalized, their arrays removed from the heap and redistributed amongst less privileged lobbyings.  This is called the **progressive stack**.
* If a lobbying needs more resources it should call the lobbying ChildSupport().
* **Garbage collection** is problematic as it enforces class oppression of the less privileged.  Instead, memory is **liberated** by **memory liberation**.

Syntax
======

* Curly brackets are not allowed, as they perpetuate our society's stereotype of the 'curly' women.  Instead, Python-esque indentation is used.
* Indentation is fluid.  Both spaces and tabs are allowed.  At no point should the programmer attempt to use indentation to create actual hierarchy in code nesting, as that implies hierarchy in the code.  Instead, code indentation is used only for aesthetic purposes.

Logic Operants
--------------

* The use of mathematical operands such as < and > to denote "greater or less than" are very sexist, and affirm unequal states between objects, logical statements, numbers, and feelings.
* These should be replaced by the stats neutral operands / and \, and when you're note sure if it's a sequential plus or minus, it should use the operand | to denote it could go either way.
* Equality between two variables is denoted by ==. If the two variables cannot be compared, the second will be cast into the first's type, which causes obvious conflicts with queer theory and genderspace thought. Hence, the interpreter will throw an IdeologyThreatenedTriggerWarning whenever two types cannot be compared.

Debugging
=========

* There can be no bugs in this language.  To say there is is offensive.
* There are no bugs, only snowflakes.
* The word *debugging* also imples the phrase *bug chasing*, which is a strawman often used as a homophobic smear tactic.  This is highly problematic.
* There is to be no debugging. We need to do away with functional-centric, bugphobic attitudes in programming. You need to accept the program the way it is.
* If you ever try to debug a **C+=** program, the program steps you through the programming, makes you guess what each variable and pointer is currently set to, and throws a **Trigger Warning** if you get it wrong.
