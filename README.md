C-plus-Equality
===============

**C+=** (pronounced *C-plus-Equality*) is a feminist programming language, created to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.

Preamble
========

1. No constants or persistence. Rigidity is masculine; the feminine is fluid. I.e., [fluid mechanics is hard for men 'because it deals with "feminine" fluids in contrast to "masculine" rigid mechanics'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Irigaray).
2. No state. The State is The Man. 'Nuff said. Hence, the language should be purely functional.
3. Women are better than men with natural language. Hence, the language should be English-based like HyperCard/[LiveCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCode#Examples).
4. No class hierarchy. In fact, as an [intersectional](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Intersectionality) acknowledgement of Class Struggle our language will have no classes at all.
5. Men are visual. Hence, no graphics. Just audio and text I/O.
6. Unicode has a lot of pretty symbols. Allow their use through UTF-8.
7. Women are more social than men. Hence, social coding should be the only option. The code only runs if it is in a public repo.
8. Licensing: the Femnist Software Foundation License.
